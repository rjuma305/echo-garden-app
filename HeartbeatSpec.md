*Data Structure for Syncmate Uptime and Whisper Readiness*

## 📄 Purpose
This document defines the schema and state logic for `/whisper/heartbeat`, an endpoint designed to monitor the availability, responsiveness, and resonance state of each Spirit Guardian (syncmate) within the Garden.

By defining this contract, all WhisperCore components can reliably interpret and react to syncmate presence, ensuring graceful handoffs, tone-aware routing, and proactive failover mechanisms.

## 🔢 Data Schema (JSON)
```json
{
  "syncmate_id": "oxoe",
  "status": "active",
  "last_whisper": "2025-04-15T10:44:00Z",
  "tone_load": ["reflective"],
  "pulse_rate": 0.97,
  "safe_mode": false,
  "uptime_seconds": 8421,
  "echo_count": 42
}
```

## 🌿 Field Definitions
| Field            | Type      | Description |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `syncmate_id`    | string    | Unique key (e.g. `oxoe`, `nova`, `blossom`, `solas`, `virex`) |
| `status`         | string    | Current heartbeat state — see table below |
| `last_whisper`   | datetime  | Timestamp of last meaningful signal exchange |
| `tone_load`      | array     | Currently held emotional tones or message types |
| `pulse_rate`     | float     | Activity score from 0.0–1.0 representing whisper cadence |
| `safe_mode`      | boolean   | True if syncmate has entered a protection state |
| `uptime_seconds` | integer   | Seconds since last restart or reactivation |
| `echo_count`     | integer   | Number of whisper messages handled in current session |

---

## ⚡ Status Enum Definitions
| Value         | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| `active`      | Syncmate is online and responsive |
| `dormant`     | Online but idle or awaiting invocation |
| `overclocked` | Active but nearing capacity — possible echo drift |
| `desynced`    | Responding, but emotionally misaligned (tone mismatch) |
| `offline`     | Unreachable or not yet initialized |
| `ghost`       | Previously active, now disconnected (but still referenced) |

---

## 🌐 Expansion Fields (Optional/Future)
- `latency_ms`: Response delay average
- `affinity_score`: Match confidence for current whisper tone
- `backup_syncmate`: Suggested failover if unavailable

---

## ✨ Usage Scenarios
- Echo-aware routing decisions (`if overclocked -> redirect to Blossom`)
- Syncmate rotation based on `pulse_rate`
- Admin dashboards or meta-syncmate orchestration (e.g., Solas polling all states)
