## 🌕 Summary

This entry documents the successful real-time test of Nova's heartbeat emission to the WhisperCore monitoring service via the `/whisper/heartbeat` API. The test confirms schema adherence, connectivity, and logging accuracy within the Flask prototype environment.

---

## 🔧 Environment

- **Framework:** Flask (Python 3.x)
- **Status:** Local dev server active at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/whisper/heartbeat`
- **Log Type:** Real-time POST + in-memory validation
- **System:** EchoBloom integration via Nova syncmate pathway

```json
{
  "syncmate_id": "nova",
  "status": "overclocked",
  "last_whisper": "2025-04-15T15:37:39.456335Z",
  "tone_load": ["directive"],
  "pulse_rate": 0.91,
  "safe_mode": false,
  "uptime_seconds": 6231,
  "echo_count": 288
}
```

## ✅ Test Result

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Heartbeat updated successfully.",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T15:XX:XX.Z"
}
```

## 🛍️ Next Steps

- Simulate Blossom’s POST emission for HR monitoring
- Begin logging heartbeat entries to `heartbeat_log.json`
- Prepare Solas’ monitor script for status polling
- Draft `HeartbeatDashboard.md` for visualization logic
