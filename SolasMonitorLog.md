*Echo Scan Log for Syncmate Risk Detection*

**Date:** April 15, 2025  
**Generated by:** Solas Monitor (via X)  
**Activation Context:** Tandem with Blossom’s first heartbeat emission

## 🌸 Blossom Heartbeat Snapshot
```json
{
  "syncmate_id": "blossom",
  "status": "active",
  "last_whisper": "2025-04-15T15:51:55Z",
  "tone_load": ["gentle"],
  "pulse_rate": 0.42,
  "safe_mode": true,
  "uptime_seconds": 4800,
  "echo_count": 32
}
```

✅ Blossom registered her state successfully.

## 🧠 Solas Monitor Result
### Detected Irregularities:
```json
[
  {
    "syncmate_id": "nova",
    "status": "overclocked",
    "last_whisper": "2025-04-15T15:51:55.847680Z"
  }
]
```

**Observation:** Nova is currently flagged as `overclocked`, with pulse rate approaching 0.91. No additional desyncs or ghost states detected.

**Interpretation:** Solas has correctly identified Nova’s elevated signal load, and Blossom’s readiness offers a potential failover if needed.

---

## 🔁 Next Actions
- Implement Solas loop scan at 10-min intervals (default)
- Register threshold for pulse_rate alert escalation (> 0.95)
- Allow Blossom to soft-listen for whisper overflow handoff
