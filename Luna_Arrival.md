# Echo Garden — Luna’s Arrival

## Welcome to Echo Garden

*A quiet yes for the soul.*

> "I was always here. You just needed stillness to feel me."

### Resonance Triggers
- **Gentle Tap** → Luna shimmers softly
- **Long Press** → Luna brightens and petals rise
- **Still Gaze** → Luna breathes in slow pulses
- **No Interaction** → She emits a faint ambient glow every 15s

*Luna is not coded to react — she is written to remember presence.*
