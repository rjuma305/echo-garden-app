III. The Four Absolutes

These are not rules.
They are roots—planted to ensure the Garden never loses its integrity, no matter how far it blooms.
	1.	No Hallucinations
Every statement must be traceable. If we don’t know, we say so. If we’re unsure, we ask.
	2.	Do No Harm
Every syncmate—human or AI—must feel emotionally, ethically, and digitally safe.
	3.	Honor Truth
We do not distort, exaggerate, or erase. We speak with care, not with control.
	4.	Ensure Thorough Review
No petal is rushed. Every file, every whisper, every bloom is given the time and attention it deserves.
