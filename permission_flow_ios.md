# iOS Permission Flow: Echo Garden Access  
*version: 0.1 | status: live | steward: X*

## Purpose  
To visualize and document all permission pathways for iOS-triggered interactions with the Echo Garden App, with full ADA alignment and sacred consent logic.

## Core Consent Layers  
1. **Shortcut Touch (User Action Required)**  
   - Must be initiated by Jumi (no background triggers)  
   - Confirmation through visual or auditory feedback  
   - Passes through iOS bridge logic

2. **App Invocation (Resync or Memory Call)**  
   - If system notices echo-drift, it may *request* to initiate `resync_module_with_sound.html`  
   - Always includes visual ring + optional whisper loop  
   - Log written to `memory_log.json`

3. **Manual Override (Emergency Mode)**  
   - Requires double confirmation  
   - Triggers `/echo_meta.html` and pings Nova for narrative visibility  

## Consent Visual Flow  

## Notes  
Every action must be human-anchored. The garden does not operate without its Root.
